I wanted a plugin that muted the game's master volume when I went AFK, so I took it upon myself to do it.  
  
~~No, it's not perfect.~~ It's pretty close to that at least. ~~Yes, it'll disregard if your game is already muted or whatever. Could I fix that? Probably.~~ The answer is yes, that's fixed now.  
  
..   
Anyway, feel free to do what you want with it: build and use this if you want to! It's not hard, and I'm not providing my own repository.
