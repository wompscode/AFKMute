# AFKMute
I wanted a plugin that muted the game's master volume when I went AFK. This didn't exist, so I took it upon myself to do it.  
No, it's not perfect. ~~Yes, it'll disregard if your game is already muted or whatever. Could I fix that? Probably.~~ The answer is yes.

Anyway, feel free to build and use this if you want it. Not sure if I'm confident enough to submit it to the main Dalamud repo, at least in its current state.
