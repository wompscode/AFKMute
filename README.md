I wanted a plugin that muted the game's master volume when I went AFK, so I took it upon myself to do it.  
  
~~No, it's not perfect.~~ It's pretty close to that at least. ~~Yes, it'll disregard if your game is already muted or whatever. Could I fix that? Probably.~~ The answer is yes, that's fixed now.  
  
It's in the main Dalamud Plugin repository. Go for it!
